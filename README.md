# Week 10 Term Project: Momentum-Based Trading Strategy

## Overview
This project implements a **momentum-based trading strategy** using historical ETF price data from **2010 to 2024**. We apply a rules-based algorithmic trading approach combining moving averages, momentum ranking, and monthly rebalancing to simulate realistic trading behavior.

The strategy focuses on tech ETFs with the potential addition of a bond ETF to reduce correlation and improve diversification.

## General Investment Philosophy
The core investment philosophy follows a **systematic momentum strategy**:

- **Buy high, sell higher**: Assets with strong recent performance (momentum) are likely to continue outperforming.
- **Use trend indicators**: 50-day and 200-day SMAs help identify bullish trends.
- **Diversification**: Including bond ETFs (e.g., TLT) mitigates risk.
- **Monthly rebalancing**: Aligns the portfolio with strongest-performing assets.

## Investment Methods & Trading Rules

### Signal Generation
- **Momentum Indicator**: 20-day price change (%)
- **Trend Filter**: Asset must pass 50-day and 200-day SMA filter
- **Ranking**: Each month, assets are ranked by momentum
- **Selection**: Top 2 momentum assets are chosen

### Portfolio Allocation
- **Equal weighting**: 50% each to top 2 assets
- **Rebalancing**: Monthly rebalancing using new momentum & SMA signals

## Portfolio Composition & Trading Summary

### Key Observations
- Tech ETFs (`QQQ`, `VGT`, `XLK`) have **very high correlation** (≥ 0.97)
- `TLT` shows **negative correlation** (~ -0.25), offering risk diversification

### Monthly Trading Summary
- Strategy avoids assets that fail SMA criteria
- Momentum rankings change monthly based on market trends

## Management Recommendation

> **Would I start a fund around this strategy?** Yes.  
The model is systematic, transparent, and performs well across different regimes.

### Preferred Role:
**Quantitative Researcher** — to extend the model with:
- Macroeconomic signals
- Volatility targeting
- Adaptive rebalancing

### Investor Sentiment:
This strategy presents a compelling case for long-term investors seeking **data-driven growth exposure**. Personally, I would invest and recommend it as a rules-based growth ETF strategy.
